# Installation 

## Using composer

### Install with [Magento Composer Installer](https://github.com/Cotya/magento-composer-installer)

```bash
composer require hirale/openmage-debug
```


# Common Issues

- 'Mage Registry key already exists' exception is raised after installation
    - `Mage registry key "_singleton/debug/observer" already exists` is reported when cache regeneration was corrupted. 
    Please try to flush Magento cache.

- Doesn'work. I see these logs on `var/log/system.log`: `Not valid template file:adminhtml/default/default/template/sheep_debug/toolbar.phtml`
    - If you installed the module using modman you've missed an important step. Search this page after 'Allow symlinks for the templates directory' and complete that step.  	
  
- I can't see toolbar.
    - Toolbar is displayed in these conditions:
        - module is installed and enabled
        - toolbar is enabled from Admin / System / Configuration / Advanced - Developer Debug Toolbar (by default it's enabled)
        - Magento is running in developer mode (MAGE_IS_DEVELOPER_MODE) Or your ip is listed under under 'Developer Client Restrictions'
    - Check that module name Sheep_Debug is installed and enabled
    - Check that 'Allow Symlinks' configuration is enabled for Modman installation

- I can't see toolbar on specific page
    - Toolbar is added to all pages that have a structural block named `before_body_end`. By default this block is available on all Magento pages.
    Eliminate a possible cache problem by disabling all caches. Try to determine if there are any customizations that have removed `before_body_end`.

- Fatal error while running unit tests
   - If you get error `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Warning: session_start(): Cannot send session cookie headers already sent by ` you should review your phpunit configuration file and redirect phpunit output to stderr, please check my configuration file from phpunit.xml
